#### Introduction

Steelhead are an important fish within the salmonid family, and population health and reproductive success depend on passage through Columbia River Basin.

Bonneville Dam was constructed in 1934, and it is the first river-wide barrier that migrating steelhead would encounter when moving upstream. When assessing the impact this blockage has had on the species, it is necessary to analyze the rates of successful salmonid passage beyond the dam over time. Understanding any trends over time related to successful passage rates will help policy makers consider the need for improved fish ladders and assistive designs.

This analysis assesses Steelhead passage time series data from the Columbia River DART program. The data is analyzes in daily, seasonal, and yearly plots in order to fully explore passage trends as salmonid spawning and travel throughout the Columbia is seasonal and often dependent on water temperatures.

The daily data for adult Steelhead passage across Bonneville Dam appears to show seasonaility, with no cyclical or long term trends. There is variation across the maximum height in each peak, which we'll next explore by making a seasonal plot, in which passage values are aggregated by month.

```{r}
# Make a season plot organized by month

fish_monthly <- fish_dates %>% 
  group_by(month, year) %>% # aggregating first by month, and then by year
  summarize(monthly_total = sum(value)) # adding the passage values across the groupings

fish_season_plot <- ggplot(data = fish_monthly, aes(x = month, y = monthly_total/1000, group = year)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = year), alpha = 0.5, size = 0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("\nMonth") +
  scale_x_discrete(limits = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "11", "12")) +
  ylab("Total Steelheead Passage per Month \n(Thousands)\n") +
  guides(color = guide_legend("Year (1939 - 2019)")) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  labs(caption = "Figure 2. Monthly Steelhead passage across Bonneville Dam")

fish_season_plot
  
```

The season plot, in which the successful passage values were aggregated by month, shows a more clear trend in the timing of fish passage. Yearly Steelhead passage appears to peak in the months of July, August, and September, though the height of the peak varies between years. Next, we'll explore yearly trends.

```{r}
# Make an annual plot

fish_yearly <- fish_dates %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(yearly_total = sum(value))

annual_plot <- ggplot(fish_yearly, aes(x = year, y = yearly_total/1000)) +
  geom_line(color = "darkolivegreen") +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("\nYear") +
  ylab("Steelhead Passage \n (Thousands)\n") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(1939, 2020)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  labs(caption = "Figure 3. Yearly Steelhead passage across Bonneville Dam from 1939 to 2019")

annual_plot
```

Aggregated by year, Steelhead passage does not seem to follow an overall trend or cyclicality. Successful passage appears to have increased in the early 2000s, before experiencing a sharp decline in more recent years.
