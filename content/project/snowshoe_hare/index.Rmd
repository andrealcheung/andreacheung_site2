Snowshoe hares are a keystone species that live in northern boreal forests. Previously, studies of snowshoe hares have been qualitative in nature, and have focused on population responses to vegetation and predators. This analysis incorporates data from capture-recapture studies that were conducted in the Tanana Valley, within the Bonanza Creek Experimental Forest. Snowshoe hare populations generally experience fluctuations on a timeline of 8 - 11 years. The following analysis focuses on the five-year period from 2008-2012, highlighting the counts and average weights of male and female hares at two sampling sites, along with the average sizes of the snowshoe hares' signature large hind foot (Table 1, Figure 1) (Kielland, Chapin & Ruess, 2017).

  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day", sep = "-")) %>%  # separate the date into three columns  
  mutate(grid = str_to_lower(grid),
         sex = str_to_lower(sex)) %>%  # make grid and sex all lower case
  filter(
    sex == "m" | sex == "f"
  ) # retain only data that is certainly male or female

```

```{r, include = FALSE}

# Add in hind foot data, since that's what they are known for

Snowshoe hare populations at the BonBS sampling site increased significantly between 2008 and 2009, before declining sharply in 2010 and continuing to decline through 2012 to counts of approximately 20 for both males and females. At the BonRip sampling grid, male counts steadily declined from 2008 to 2012, while females remained in higher numbers to 2011 before sharply declining in 2012. At BonRip, both males and female counts were near 0 at the end of the study period. Despite the volatility in hare counts, average hind foot size remained relatively constant, and no discernible relationship with count could be determined.
