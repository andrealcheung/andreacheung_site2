I am a science-driven storyteller, working to change the way people and businesses see the environment, and each other.

My passions will always be rooted in science. I first became interested in academic research as an undergraduate working in a plant pathology lab at UC Davis where I investigated the role of viruses in plant-insect interactions.  It was here that I became curious in the intricacies and importance of ecological relationships. This curiosity led me to work in bat conservation, and then to Amazon in Ecuador as a volunteer at a wildlife rescue center, where gained a greater understanding of the diverse ways different communities interact and depend on the environment. Following graduation from UC Davis with a BS in Animal Biology, I became a research associate at UC San Diego identifying drug targets for malaria before I began a masterâ€™s program in Environmental Science and Management at the Bren School at UC Santa Barbara. 

I am currently finishing up the second-year of master's program and specializing in corporate environmental management. I am passionate about applying my research experience and corporate environmental training to help entrepreneurs, innovators, and companies create a greener and more inclusive economy.
